# MT19 - DTC demonstration - coursework solutions
This repository contains the solutions to the coursework of the submodule **Iterative methods for solving linear systems** of the DTC module **Modelling and Scientific Computing**. 

As course TAs, we did the solutions on our own during the demonstration period, thus we do not guarantee the correctness of the answers. We hope the solutions serve as temporary reference to students whenever in need.

Have fun with coding!

Covered concepts:
* Richardson iteration (Jacobi, Gauss_Seicdel & SOR)
* Steepest descent & Conjugate gradient descent
